        "project-description":"This beautiful lampshade, crafted by hand, was made December/January 2023-2024. I found the perfect lamp stand, clothing fabric, and wire frame from Goodwill. Drawing inspiration from my observations while watching Ace of Shades, I stripped the lampshade and began the process. I sewed strips of fabric around the wire so each panel would be able to be sewn on. I repurposed fabric from a pillowcase and two shirts to make foundational panels for each section of the frame. Then I adorned the lampshade with delicate lace and intricate beadwork gathered from diverse sourcesâ€”my personal collection, Joann's, and a local bead store. My finishing touch was the white trim on the top and bottom of the shade, covering all the threads from sewing each part. All that was left was to assemble my lamp!"

The bracelet is constructed from 24 gauge silver nickel sheet metal. I constructed the design by experimenting with paper, cutting and folding until I felt I found the best design. I had to saw out my metal, clean up the edges, sand it to remove marks from pliers and other tools I used in the process. Next, I sand-blasted and tumbled the piece to get the shiny, chrome illusion on the metal."

Usually they are decorated very cutely, but they are time consuming to make. I made a web application that simulates a bullet journal where users can log in and make notes and use a dynamically created calendar. I used IndexedDB and session storage to hold information about the users and their saved notes. Since it is a bullet journal, I created a JSON file with different themes that users can save for each month of the calendar so if you save a Christmas theme for December, December of that year will always be Christmas themed regardless of the themes from other months. This project was completed for a Web Application class at James Madison University.",

The objective of Max3Sat is to obtain the maximum count of clauses that yield a true evaluation. Each clause is written in CNF notation and each variable can be affirmed or negated. In my problem, I was given the number of variables, the number of clauses in one line, and each clause on separate input lines. Using the Brute Force algorithm, I explored all possible truth assignments for each variable and evaluated the expression. Following each evaluation, I compared the previous maximum truth count with the evaluated truth count to get the maximum number of true clauses. The algorithm prints the maximum number of clauses that are evaluated to true and the truth values that are associated with each variable. Consequently, this algorithm operates in exponential time.",

I was inspired by our tiny pond in the backyard, and wanted to bring it inside. I painted the fish first, and then the water around them to make them pop out more, and to look like they're freely swimming in some beautiful water."

I started by making the 3d object. I decided to put an octopus queen on a star throne engulfed in flowers, eating ice cream and surrounded by flames. You see, I love octopi and the ocean, space, flowers, ice cream, and fire. The reason I put made the octopus the octopus queen is because I am the octopus, in charge of my life and queen of me. I built the box in the woodshop before staining it and using acrylic paint to make the outside look more worn. I painted the inside of the box red because that is my favorite color. My professor made paper clay, a medium that I was unfamiliar with. I was curious so I decided to implement it into my project by creating vines that wrapped around my box and held the box and the lid up at different angles. I used wire to support the vines so the box would not crumple down. To add further details, I added smaller yarn roots and painted the clay and yarn to look more wood-like. I made the outside more guarded with a peek inside, because I try to keep myself guarded, but do let people in. I imagine that my box is int he process of falling to the ocean floor, levitating from the water current, but held together by the vines."

She was having trouble finding artists so she asked me to make a piece for her(I am not Latino); I was thrilled. The theme was Life, Death, and Memory. At first I was unsure of what to paint. I did some research and found out that in Mexican culture, it is said that the Monarch Butterflies are spirits of their ancestors visiting them again. I think that is beautiful and it reminded me of my Great Grandma, who I was close to when I was young. She told me that after she died, she would visit me as a butterfly. I also found out that people put flowers on the altars for their family members, so I felt that I needed to include some beautiful foliage in my painting. I decided to put her in a beautiful forest full of life. In the background, there is her coffin that is overgrown with soft moss and grass. In the foreground, there is a small monarch butterfly, which represents her visiting me in the physical world."
